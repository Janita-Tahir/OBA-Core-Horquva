/**
 * navigationCatalog.js — Task 12.2
 * Maps a dashboard page slug to its real frontend route and a human label.
 *
 * The slugs here are kept identical to PAGE_CATALOG in agent/pageContext.js
 * (T12.7) on purpose — the two catalogs describe the same set of pages from
 * two angles: pageContext.js pulls metrics for a page, this pulls where to
 * actually send the user. pageContext.js's own header comment already
 * expects to import a slug -> route mapping from this task at runtime.
 *
 * Routes were confirmed against the real frontend/app pages rather than
 * guessed:
 *   - risks/health share /risk (OrgHealthBanner lives there alongside the
 *     risk panels)
 *   - governance shares /continuity (GovernanceTab is a tab on that page,
 *     not a separate route)
 *   - dashboard/briefing share / (the root page renders DailyBriefingCard)
 *   - dependencies -> /ownership (Ownership Intelligence), not /map --
 *     /map is a dependency graph visualization, a different thing from the
 *     ownership-concentration metrics PAGE_CATALOG['dependencies'] extracts
 *   - predictive -> /forecast, collaboration -> /org-science (both matched
 *     directly on page title/imports)
 *
 * Design rules:
 *   • Read-only, static data. No DB calls, nothing computed at runtime.
 *   • Exported so any module (pageContext.js included) can resolve a route
 *     for a slug without duplicating this list.
